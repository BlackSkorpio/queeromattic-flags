# Queeromattic Flags üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üéâ

Create your own downloadable WordPress pride flag SVG.

<img src="./public/flag.svg" width="300" />

There are some predefined pride flags already configured, or you can customize
your own with as many rows as you want. There are some colors preset that work
well together, or you can set your own colors using hex codes or `rgb()`.

The pre-set flags are:

* Agender
* Aromantic
* Asexual
* Bisexual
* Gay #MoreColorMorePride
* Gay (Rainbow)
* Genderfluid
* Genderqueer
* Nonbinary
* Pansexual
* Polysexual
* Transgender

## Development

To run this locally, you can clone and install the repo with the following
commands

```
git clone git@github.com:ryelle/queeromattic-flags.git
cd queeromattic-flags
npm install
npm start
```

It should open a browser window with the app running, or you can visit the URL
generated when it finishes compiling. This will also keep the process open and
watching for changes, so you can edit any of the `src` files and the app will
reload with your changes (note: it will also randomly regenerate a flag).

### CSS

The CSS is generated from the Sass files in `src/scss`, if you want to update
styles, do so in these files, not the generated `style.css` file.
